# Playing with CapsLock LED in ANSI C99 on RISC OS

This simple code example shows how to use RISC OS SWIs (SysCalls) in ANSI C99.

## How to build the code

Ensure you have the Acorn/ROOL DDE suite installed on your RISC OS system and that RISC OS Desktop Filer has seen it.

Git clone this repository in a way that can be reached by your RISC OS system, if you do not know how to do this have a look at [this set of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEnraaJ9VQfWDl5T4D0P51pG89KRzj0n1) on the matter that can help you to find the best approach for you to use git with your RISC OS.

Then, from your RISC OS system, run !CC (you can find it in $.Apps.DDE) or have a look at the sources in the subdirectory named `c`.

For a full description of how the code works have a look at this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qukQiL4iijY)

Enjoy!
